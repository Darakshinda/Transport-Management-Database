# Transport Management System

## Project Overview

The Transport Management System project simplifies and streamlines bus and taxi transportation services through the integration of a robust Database Management System (DBMS). The project leverages SQL for database management, XAMPP as the web server solution, and Python for scripting and backend logic. The system focuses on enhancing efficiency, transparency, and user experience in managing transportation services.

## Goals

1. **Automation of Operations:** Develop a comprehensive Transport Management System (TMS) to automate various aspects of transportation management, including route planning, scheduling, ticketing, and reporting.

2. **Database Management:** Implement a reliable and scalable database using SQL to store and manage data related to vehicles, routes, schedules, passengers, and transactions.

3. **User-Friendly Interface:** Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both administrators and end-users to facilitate easy interaction with the system.

## Specifications

The proposed system utilizes a three-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer:** Developed using Python-based frameworks (e.g., Flask) for a dynamic and responsive user interface.

2. **Application Layer:** Python scripts for backend logic, business rules, and seamless integration with the database.

3. **Data Layer:** A MySQL database managed using SQL to store and retrieve information related to routes, schedules, vehicles, passengers, and transactions.

## Technologies Used

I. **Database Management System:**
   - MySQL for robust and efficient data management.

II. **Server:**
    - XAMPP for a cross-platform web server solution, ensuring compatibility and ease of deployment.

III. **High-Level Language:**
    - Python for scripting, logic implementation, and seamless integration with the database.
